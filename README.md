# Guessing_Number_Game
This is a simple number-guessing game implemented in JavaScript. The program generates a random number between 1 and a user-defined maximum limit. Players are prompted to guess the number, with hints provided if their guess is too high or too low.
The game continues until the player correctly guesses the number or chooses to quit by entering "quit."
Features:
Generates a random number based on user input for the maximum value.
Provides real-time feedback for user guesses.
Allows the user to exit the game by typing "quit."
Displays a congratulatory message upon correct guessing.
This project is a fun and interactive way to practice JavaScript programming and understand basic concepts like loops, conditionals, and user input handling.
